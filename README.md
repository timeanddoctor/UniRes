# Unified Super-Resolution in PyTorch  用在CT 修改了参数
<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/brudfors/UniRes/blob/master/figures/example_2.png" width="100%" height="100%"> 

This repository implements a unified model for super-resolving medical images (MRI and CT scans), which combines: super-resolution with a multi-channel denoising 
prior, rigid registration and a correction for interleaved slice acquisition. 
The archetype use-case is when having multiple scans of the same subject 
(e.g., T1w, T2w and FLAIR MRIs) and an analysis requires these scans to be 
represented on the same grid (i.e., having the same image size, affine matrix 
and voxel size). By default, the model reconstructs 1 mm isotropic images 
with a field-of-view that contains all input scans; however, this voxel 
size can be customised with the possibility of sub-millimetric reconstuctions. 
The model additionally supports multiple repeats of each MR sequence. 
There is an option that makes images registered and defined on the same grid, 
**across subjects**, where the grid size is optimal from a CNN fitting perspective.
The implementation is written in *PyTorch* and should therefore execute fast 
on the GPU. The software can be run either through **Docker** -- which ensures 
the correct library and OS versions are used, plus requires no compilation -- 
or directly by interfacing with the **Python** code.

An installation-free demo of UniRes is available in Colab:

## 1. Python

### 1.1. Installation
Clone `UniRes`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/brudfors/UniRes
```
Then `cd` into the `UniRes` folder and install it by:
```shell
pip install .
```
**OBS**: The algorithm runs much faster if the compiled backend is used:
```shell
NI_COMPILED_BACKEND="C" pip install --no-build-isolation .
```
However, for running on the GPU, this only works if you ensure that the PyTorch installation uses the same CUDA version that is on your system; therefore, it might be worth installing PyTorch beforehand, *i.e.*:
```shell
pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111
NI_COMPILED_BACKEND="C" pip install --no-build-isolation .
```
where the PyTorch CUDA version matches the output of `nvcc --version`.

### 1.2. Example usage

Running *UniRes* is straight forward. Let's say you have three 
MR images: `T1.nii.gz`, `T2.nii.gz` and `PD.nii.gz`, then 
simply run `unires` in the terminal as:
``` bash
unires T1.nii.gz T2.nii.gz PD.nii.gz
```
Three 1 mm isotropic images are written to the same folder as the input
 data, prefixed `'ur_'`. 
 
Algorithm options can be displayed by:
``` bash
unires --help
```
As an example, the voxel size of the super-resolved data is here set to
 1.5 mm isotropic:
``` bash
unires --vx 1.5 T1.nii.gz T2.nii.gz PD.nii.gz
```
There is also an option that makes images registered and defined on the same grid, 
**across subjects**, where the grid size is optimal from a CNN fitting perspective:
``` bash
unires --common_output T1.nii.gz T2.nii.gz PD.nii.gz
```
As the unified super-resolution can take a few minutes (on a fast GPU ;), it is possible to instead
use a trilinear reslice, this is enabled by:
``` bash
unires --linear --common_output T1.nii.gz T2.nii.gz PD.nii.gz
```

## 2. Running through NVIDIA Docker
This section describes setting up *UniRes* to run using NVIDIA's Docker 
engine on Ubuntu. As long as the NVIDIA Docker engine can be installed on 
MS Windows or Mac OSX there is no reason that these operating systems could 
not also be used. However, setting it up for Windows and OSX is not 
described here.

### 2.1. Install NVIDIA driver and Docker
Make sure that you have **installed** the **NVIDIA driver** and **Docker 
engine** for **your Linux distribution** (you do not need to install the 
CUDA Toolkit on the host system). These commands should install Docker:
``` bash
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo systemctl start docker && sudo systemctl enable docker
```
Regarding the NVIDIA driver, I personally like the installation guide in 
[1] (step 2). Although this guide is targeted at Ubuntu 19.04, it should 
generalise to other Debian/Ubuntu versions (I used it for Ubuntu 18.04). 

### 2.2. Install the NVIDIA Docker engine
Execute the following commands to install the NVIDIA Docker engine:
``` bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
```
Next, edit/create `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with content (e.g., by `sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json`):
```
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
         } 
    },
    "default-runtime": "nvidia" 
}
```
then do:
``` bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
Finally, test that it works by starting *nvidia-smi* in a Docker container:
``` bash
sudo docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi
```

### 2.3. Build UniRes Docker image
`cd` to the content of the `docker` folder and run the following command to 
build the *UniRes* image:
``` bash
docker build --rm --tag unires:1.0 .
```
If there are permission issues, the following can help:
``` bash
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```
Now you can run *UniRes* via Docker containers started from the `unires:1.0` 
image!

### 2.4. Process MRI scans through Docker container
Let's say you have a folder named `data` in your current working directory, 
which contains two MR images of the same subject: `T1.nii.gz`, `PD.nii.gz`. 
You can then process these two scans with *UniRes* by executing:
``` bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/data:/home/docker/app/data unires:1.0 data/T1.nii.gz data/PD.nii.gz
```
When the algorithm has finished, you will find the processed scans in
 the same `data` folder, prefixed `'ur_'`.
